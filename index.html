              Hi , Im Pariket koirala ,Im currently 
                pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a unique background 
                rooted in the Koirala family of Nepal, a prominent business and political family in Nepal.
                My family, the Koiralas, have played a significant role in various commercial ventures
                , including ownership of commercial buildings, Enliv Technology Nepal, Adnepal, 
                the former Shree Subha Laxmi Enterprise PVT LTD, and Laxmi Import and Export Pvt.
                We also have the honor of serving as trustees for two revered temples: Durga Temple in Urlabari 
                and Kali Temple in Biratnagar.Notably, some of my family members are actively engaged as board of trustees
                in Shree Pashupatinath Foundation USA, a role that exemplifies our family's commitment 
                to philanthropy and community service, both in Nepal and on an international level.Among our diverse family business ventures, 
                some Family own and operate Nora Threading Center, in various parts of California.
        

                In addition to my family's legacy, 
                I hold a strong aspiration 
                to become a software engineer and leverage my 
                skills for the digital development of rural areas across South 
                East Asia. Currently, I possess proficiency in the Python programming language, a versatile tool that I intend 
                to leverage to achieve my goals. Furthermore, I am driven by the determination to build something of my own from the ground up, without relying on my family's financial resources, in order to create a lasting impact on the world.
                As I delve into the field of Computer Science, my overarching goal is to become a software engineer. This aspiration is driven by my passion for technology and innovation. With a background in business and a desire to leverage technology for positive change, I see software engineering as the bridge that will allow me 
                to contribute effectively to the digital growth and development of rural areas in South East Asia.
