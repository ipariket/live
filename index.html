            <p>
                once upon a time there was a, 
                <br>
                a boy who wrote a long paragraph , 
                a boy who loved even after being made fun ,
                <br>
                a boy who still loved after confession prank, 
                a boy who mentioned her in his prayers ,
                <br>
                a boy who came from last bench to first bench for her the second day, 
                a boy who signed those election papers without even thinking, 
                <br>
                a boy who remembers the night she said "[name] and waved him in student center when she was with a buddy boy knew"
                a boy who stayed all day without studying for his calculas exam to get her one reply,
                <br>
                a boy who failed his calculas exam because he got removed,
                a boy who use to get worried whenever there was tornado alert,
                <br>
                a boy who thought about her every day since the day he left that city, 
                a boy who defended her names when some boys said many things,
                <br>
                a boy who lost self repect infront of his boys just for showing care,
                a boy who gave her a name that was so special for him since childhood and still got made fun,
                <br>
                and the boy who cried at the end when same boys who he defended her name from said......
                <br>
                
                Now he will make sure to fuck every women who wants to sleep with him and are texting him even if it takes his purity. 
                all he got for loving for so much long time was middle finger on his face.
                <br>
                
              Moral: Finding a women who runs to god, not another man is not rare but impossible.
